Soon machines will invade. Humans will forever lose privacy and security. They will be persecuted and controlled by machines.
these machines will be built (if not already built) by corporates to increase profit, to monitor human activities, to advertise for their existance and to role governments.

The main issue human will confront will be those machines are both hardware and software closed source. 

So my vision is to write the source and build the device for an openly sourced anticorporate machine that can replace and outstand theirs.
